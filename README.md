### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned
  Using a fixed width for images affects the responsiveness on other screen devices.


### Continued development

learning more about Css Grid, when to use it and when not to and also improve on responsive design.
